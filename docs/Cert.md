# Certificates

Certificates are the most important aspect of authentication throughout the entire app. When a user is created (or logs in using a new password), a new certificate is generated for them. That certificate is tied to a role, and thus a series of permissions it grants the user. 

Certificates are passed as a header in every frontend-> backend http request, and are used to determine admin status. 

Certificates are generated by generating a new uuid, then passing it through bcrypt.
