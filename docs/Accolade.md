# Accolades

The accolade-badge system is a mess of JSON and strings. It's really better implemented and summarized on the frontend's achievement_manager.dart.

I'm leaving the annotated methods as the documentation. As a more complex part of the project, this is left as an exercise for future devs to document to gain a better understanding of it.
