## Q: Why are there python files?
A: Because the TBA API for Go is old and I didn't feel like updating it, and because python can be quickly inter-opped with Go.

## Q: What's with appsScripts.js?
A: This is a google extension file, meant to be passed into a google sheet/project. It provides the definitions for new functions to be used in google sheets.

## Q: Why Go? 
A: It's very fast with great concurrency. It's somewhat object-oriented, so java programmers aren't totally thrown into the deep end. It forces error handling, which is just good practice. It's memory safe. It's got a lot of great advanced features, like goroutines, channels, and contexts. 

Go is the best backend language that doesn't run on the erlang VM, and all of those languages are powerful yet weird tools that operate on functional programming - way too big of a departure from what FRC programmers typically know. 

Also, I've never found a good SQL library for an erlang-derived language.

### Who do I ask questions to?
A: For general programming questions, your code leads and mentors. For Go-specific questions, ask other app devs or Jose. For Project-specific questions, ask either your app devs, app mentors, or, ONLY IF YOU HAVE TO, contact Tag.
