This app has been my passion project for the back half of my last season on 1816. It's been awesome learning this new language and all these skills that come with it. I just want to leave a little farewell note.

Thank you.

To Ethan and Henry for being the best rookies ever and putting up with my horrible teaching,

To Elena, the best CSP lead partner I could have asked for, for being my sane counterbalance,

To Micheal, my app-dev partner, for coming up with the idea for the app and being basically my coding twin,

To DDay, for teaching me so much and helping me develop as a teacher,

To Mika, for also teaching me so much, always hearing me out, and letting me develop as a leader,

To Nico, Keerthi, Mia, and Rachith for teaching me in my rookie year,

To Ms. Poulos, for getting me on the team in the first place,

To all those that came before me for laying the foundations,

To John, Leon, and all those that will come after me and build on what I've built,

To Woolsey for indulging my constant additions to the app in competition,

And to FRC, for existing, really.

I wish you all nothing but the best in the years to come. Covid really decimated this team for a bit, but now we're finally back on track and I'm eternally grateful I was a part of it, even if only for two years.

Eyes on the future.
